# Adabdha Project

***Adabdha (aːdaːbdʱa:)*** in Sanskrit means an unbroken chain that can be traced to its source. The core tenet of this project is to offer a decentralized alternative to the traditionally accepted opaque process of granting of licenses and permissions, whether in the physical or the digital world.
